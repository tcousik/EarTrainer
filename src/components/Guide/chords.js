      <h1>Chords Guide</h1>
      <h3>
        An interval refers to the distance between two notes. Intervals are the
        most basic part of ear training. In Western music, there are 13 notes in
        an octave. Therefore, there are 13 commonly studied intervals and a
        couple rare ones that go beyond the octave. Each interval has a quantity
        and a quality. The quantity refers to the general distance between the
        notes, while the quality is more specific about that distance.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        For example, the quantity of the interval between a C and an Eâ™­ is 3 or
        a 3rd while the quality is minor. So the interval is known as a minor
        3rd. The interval between a C and E, however, is known as a major 3rd.
        This section will introduce all the intervals with audio examples.
